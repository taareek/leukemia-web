## leukemia-web
This repository contains a web application for the automated diagnosis of Leukemia Cancer. We have employed a hybrid approach by integrating machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop this Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system. FastAPI was employed as the framework to create the proposed model as an API in this project. It represents the implementation of our proposed model, as detailed in the paper titled 'Addressing Label Noise in Leukemia Image Classification Using Small Loss Approach and pLOF with Average-Weighted Ensemble.
